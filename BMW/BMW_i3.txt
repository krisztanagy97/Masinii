The BMW i3 is a five-door urban electric car developed by the German car manufacturer BMW. The i3 is part of BMW's "Project i" and was launched as a new brand, BMW i.[12][13][14][15][16] The i3 is BMW's first zero emissions mass-produced vehicle due to its electric powertrain, and BMW is the first company to launch a volume production vehicle on the market featuring carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer to improve the vehicle's energy consumption.[17] Until November 2016, the BMW i3 was the most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle of all years regardless of fuel type, while the i3 REx continues to rank as the most efficient EPA-certified current year vehicle with a gasoline engine in terms of its combined gasoline/electricity rating.[18][19][20]
