The Audi A5 is a series of compact executive cars produced by the German automobile manufacturer Audi since 2007. The A5 range comprises the coupé, cabriolet, and "Sportback" (a five-door hatchback coupé featuring a fastback-like roofline with a steeply raked rear window with integrated trunk lid) version of the Audi A4 saloon and estate models.
Under Audi's internal platform numbering convention, the A5 is a member of the B-platform series of vehicles, sharing its platform designation with the A4 saloon and Avant. The first generation A5 (Type 8T) is therefore a member of the B8 family, whilst the second generation 2016 model is based on the B9.[2] Both are derived from the Volkswagen MLB (Modular Longditudinal Matrix) architecture.
