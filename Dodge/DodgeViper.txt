The Dodge Viper is a sports car manufactured by Dodge (SRT for 2013 and 2014), a division of FCA US LLC from 1992 through 2017 having taken a brief hiatus from 2010-2013. Production of the two-seat sports car began at New Mack Assembly in 1991 and moved to Conner Avenue Assembly in October 1995.
Although Chrysler considered ending production because of serious financial problems,[1][2] on September 14, 2010, chief executive Sergio Marchionne announced and showed a new model of the Viper for 2012.[3] In 2014 the Viper was named number 10 on the "Most American Cars" list, meaning 75% or more of its parts are manufactured in the U.S.[4] The Viper was initially conceived in late 1988 at Chrysler's Advanced Design Studios. The following February, Chrysler president Bob Lutz suggested to Tom Gale at Chrysler Design that the company should consider producing a modern Cobra, and a clay model was presented to Lutz a few months later. Produced in sheet metal by Metalcrafters,[5] the car appeared as a concept at the North American International Auto Show in 1989. Public reaction was so enthusiastic that chief engineer Roy Sjoberg was directed to develop it as a standard production vehicle.
